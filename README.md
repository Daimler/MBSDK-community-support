# Central collaboration space for the App community of the Mercedes-Benz Mobile SDK  

## Intended Usage

The Mercedes-Benz Mobile SDK.

The Mercedes-Benz Mobile SDK (Software Development Kit) encapsulates **customer and car data** and **vehicle functions** needed to develop mobile apps for Mercedes Benz cars, which are enabled for Mercedes me services. 

In addition, the SDK provides basic functions like registration, password-less login, vehicle assignment and service activation for all SDK app developers and thus helps them to concentrate on the main purpose and business value of the app.\
The underlying architecture is reliable and includes worldwide scalable components for building your own Mercedes-Benz Mobile app.

We provide all **modules** and **documentation** for Android and iOS to include into your native app.\
Also, we provide an **sample app** for your reference, to allow quickly understand the power of the SDK. This app can be build easily by everyone and may be helpful while you develop your own app. 

We also provide two **Example Apps** of the SDK for Android and iOS which allow you to first see and understand how the SDK works, these are contained in two separate repostories, listed below.
